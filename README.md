# Lostie
Work In Progress / Pet Scanner app - help lost pets / Vue3 &amp; NodeJS <br />
This project helps tracking and scanning lost pets. <br/>
You can sign up, place an order and get a custom styled NFC tag, <br />
that includes information on your pet, and how to contact you if found. <br />
you can change the status and info of the tag in real-time. <br />
Once the tag is scanned, the browser shows full information page about the pet. <br />

## About the technologies I have used here: 
This is the first project I am building with Vue 3 <br />
In my opinion Vue 3 is a great framework, combining the pros of React and Angular. <br />
The problem? It's small community makes it hard to find fixes and solutions online, <br />
and it's lack of libraries makes it harder to use.

Live hosting of this project is at https://lostie.herokuapp.com/ <br/>
