# Lostie

Work In Progress // Pet Scanner app - help lost pets // Vue3 &amp; NodeJS <br />
This project helps tracking and scanning lost pets. <br/>
You can sign up, place an order and get a custom styled NFC tag, <br />
that includes information on your pet, and how to contact you if found. <br />
you can change the status and info of the tag in real-time. <br />
Once the tag is scanned, the browser shows full information page about the pet. <br />

## About the technologies I have used here:

This is the first project I am building an app with Vue 3 <br />
In my opinion Vue 3 is a great framework, combining the pros of React and Angular. <br />
The problem? It's small community makes it hard to find fixes and solutions online, <br />
and it's lack of libraries makes it harder to use. <br />
In this project I used PrimeVue UI library and Pinia as global state management. <br />
Routing with Vue Router, with guards and authroizations. <br />
Google Maps integration, with custom markers in home page, using the great library vue-google-maps by fawmi. <br />
The backend is Node.js - express, and MongoDB. <br />


Live hosting of this project is at https://lostie.herokuapp.com/ <br/>
Please allow about 30 seconds for the server to boot <br />
If you want to see what happens when you scan a tag you can visit https://lostie.herokuapp.com/tag/622cfbe5f8adb230968c75e5 <br/>
